# Pros and Cons of Test-Driven Development (TDD)

On the positive side, TDD promotes the creation of high-quality code by encouraging developers to write tests before implementing the actual code. This approach results in cleaner, more modular, and well-structured code, reducing the likelihood of defects and improving overall software quality. TDD also facilitates early bug detection, helping catch and rectify issues initially. Tests also serve as documentation for expected behaviour, making the code more maintainable and guiding the design process. Furthermore, it offers the benefit of regression testing, ensuring that existing functionality remains intact. However, TDD does come with drawbacks. Initially, it can slow development, and maintaining a large suite of tests requires effort. Incomplete test coverage can leave gaps in protection, and it might not be suitable for all project types. There's also the learning curve and the risk of writing tests that check implementation details rather than desired behaviour. The effectiveness of TDD ultimately depends on the team's discipline and the project's characteristics.
